# Optimized Minecraft Server Configuration Files
This repository contains all the optimized configuration files for a Minecraft server.

### Versions:
+ [1.18](https://github.com/Mocab/Optimized-configs/tree/1.18)
+ [1.19](https://github.com/Mocab/Optimized-configs/tree/1.19)

### Navigation:
To navigate between and from versions, use the "Versions" section above, or use the branch switcher at the top left of the page.

## Usage:
**Prerequisites:**
+ An already set up Purpur/Paper/Pufferfish server

> These configurations should work in any server using [Paper](https://papermc.io) or any of its forks ([Purpur](https://purpurmc.org), [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish), etc). However you may need to remove some of the configuration files. As an example, Paper does not need `purpur.yml` or `pufferfish.yml`.

## Changes:
These configs slightly change certain aspects of the game, however these are usually insignificant or are not noticeable. They may still break plugins and/or farms (unlikely), so we recommend that you go through the changes made and make any adjustments as seen fit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### These configs were optimized based on [Paper Chanâ€™s Little Guide to Minecraft Server Optimization!](https://eternity.community/index.php/paper-optimization/) and [Minecraft server optimization guide](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization). I would highly recommend going through them, as they contain a lot of useful information explained in detail.

> Do not forget to set `server-port=25565` (server.properties) to your server's port.
