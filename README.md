# Optimized Minecraft Server Configuration Files
This repository contains all the optimized configuration files for a Minecraft server.

### Versions:
+ [1.18](https://github.com/Mocab/Optimized-Minecraft-server-configurations/blob/main/1.18/README.md)
+ [1.19](https://github.com/Mocab/Optimized-Minecraft-server-configurations/blob/main/1.19/README.md)

## Usage:
Prerequisites:
+ An already set up Minecraft server

These configs should work in any server using [Paper](https://papermc.io) or any of its forks ([Purpur](https://purpurmc.org), Pufferfish, etc), but you may need to remove some of the config files. For example Paper does not need `purpur.yml` or `pufferfish.yml`.


## Changes:
These configs slightly change certain aspects of the game, however these are usually insignificant or are not noticeable. They may still break plugins and/or farms (unlikely), so we recommend that you go through the changes made and make any changes needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These configs were optimized based on [Paper Chanâ€™s Little Guide to Minecraft Server Optimization!](https://eternity.community/index.php/paper-optimization/) and [Minecraft server optimization guide](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization), I would highly recommend going through them, they contain a lot of information which could help you.

> Do not forget to set `server-port=25565` (server.properties) to your server's port.
